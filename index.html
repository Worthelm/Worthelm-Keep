Once upon a time, there was a dragon named Helios. Every morning, we rode to wake up the day. Helios would shoot brightness, fire made out of Love. They followed the river that split the world whose sides were connected by bridges, enveloped in clouds, made out of rainbows.
<br><br><br> In this realm, there were proportions, symbols, shields, an <b>emblem</b>, a map (of sorts), phrases, shapes‚Äîtongues licking the banner~edge. . .
<br><br><br>  Mostly, though, it was a place about the <div class="shadow"> <i>flight on top of the paradox </div>, the easy glide over the </i>  <h2> bliss </h2><i>of <b>this</b>, and </i> <u>that</u>.
