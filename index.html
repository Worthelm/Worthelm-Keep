Once upon a time there was a dragon named Helios. Every morning, we rode to wake the day. Helios would shoot brightness, a fire made out of Love. They followed the river that split the world whose sides were connected by cloud-kissed bridges made out of rainbows.
<br><br><br> In this realm, there were proportions, symbols, shields, an <b>emblem</b>, a map (of sorts), phrases, shapes‚Äîtongues licking the banner~edge. . .
<br><br><br>  Mostly, though, it was a place about the <i>flight on top of the paradox, the easy glide over the </i> bliss <i>of this, and that. </i>
